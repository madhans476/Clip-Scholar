# Clip-Scholar

Clipscholar is an application designed to automate the extraction of transcripts from 
YouTube videos, generating structured notes and customizable quizzes.
Developed using Flask, the YouTube Transcript API, and the 
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 model, Clipscholar was evaluated 
on 10 educational videos, demonstrating effective summarization 
and quiz generation capabilities. Key features include 
Markdown-formatted note exports and support for multiple 
quiz formats, such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs), 
fill-in-the-blanks, and question-answer pairsHf.
