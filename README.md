# Clip-Scholar

Clipscholar is an application designed to automate the extraction of transcripts from <br/>
YouTube videos, generating structured notes and customizable quizzes. <br/>

Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 model, Clipscholar was evaluated <br/>
on 10 educational videos, demonstrating effective summarization <br/>
and quiz generation capabilities. Key features include <br/>
Markdown-formatted note exports and support for multiple <br/>
quiz formats, such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs), <br/>
fill-in-the-blanks, and question-answer pairsHf.<br/>
